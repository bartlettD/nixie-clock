# nixie-clock
A Nixie Tube based clock. Because everyone has to play with Nixies once, right?

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to design and contstruct a simple 4/6-Digit clock based around a set of [IN-12B Nixie Tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixie_tube). They are a type of cold-cathode display neon readout tube invented in the 1950's and used commonly in the USSR in volume manufacture until the 1980's after the rest of the world had moved on to 7-Segment LED arrays and other indicator technologies.
